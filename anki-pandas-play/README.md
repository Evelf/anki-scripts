Plays with AnkiPandas ( https://github.com/klieret/AnkiPandas/ )


Notes :
- For something to be shown, we need to call `plt.show()` after mapping everything.
- To save the graph in SVG, it's possible to call `plt.savefig("test.svg", format="svg")`. This
  must be donne BEFORE the call to `plt.show()`.
